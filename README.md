# `mtg-mode.el`

`mtg-mode` is a *Major Mode* for rendering and editing Magic the Gathering cards.

## Features

* Prettify symbols â€” e.g. `{2}{U}` as *â‘¡ðŸ’§* (via `prettify-symbols-mode`).
* Docs (via `eldoc-mode`).

## Prettify Symbols

Render symbols either:

* as Unicode, for portability â€” e.g. `{2}{U}` as *â‘¡ðŸ’§*.
* as Images, for prettiness â€” e.g. `{2}{U}` as <span><abbr class="mtg-two-generic-mana">{2}</abbr><abbr class="mtg-blue-mana">{U}</abbr></span>

Customize `mtg-prettify-symbols-style`:

* `nil` means â€” no prettification (display text between curly-braces literally).
* `'characters` means â€” display as *Unicode Characters*.
* `'images` means â€” display as *SVG Images*.

Customize `mtg-prettify-symbols-*-alist` to:

* Replace the default images/characters.
* Register your own *Symbols* and how to display them.

e.g. Register a custom symbol and its display character:

``` elisp
(add-to-list 'mtg-prettify-symbols-characters-alist '("U/H" . ?))
```

e.g. Register a custom symbol and its display image:

``` elisp
(add-to-list 'mtg-prettify-symbols-images-alist '("U/H" . ""))
```
