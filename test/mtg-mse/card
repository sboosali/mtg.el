	rule text: Counter target spell. If that spell is countered this way, appropriate it instead of putting it into its owner’s graveyard. <i-auto>(Exile it face-down. You may look at and cast it for as long as it remains exiled, and you may spend mana as though it were mana of any type to cast it.)</i-auto>
